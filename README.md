DatabaseTest - SQLite
=========

This is my attempt to use SQLite Databases on the Android Platform.

This is what my project implements:

  - Custom ListView Adapter (Based on SimpleCursorAdapter)
  - Loaders
  - Standardized Content Provider to interact with the database
  - DbAdapter Class with Add, Delete, Update and DeleteAll methods

What is SQLite?

> SQLite is an Open Source database. SQLite supports standard relational database
> features like SQL syntax, transactions and prepared statements. The database
> requires limited memory at runtime (approx. 250 KByte) which makes it a good
> candidate from being embedded into other runtimes.

                                            
> SQLite supports the data types TEXT (similar to String in Java), INTEGER (similar > to long in Java) and REAL (similar to double in Java). All other types must be
> converted into one of these fields before getting saved in the database. SQLite
> itself does not validate if the types written to the columns are actually of the
> defined type, e.g. you can write an integer into a string column and vice versa.

> More information about SQLite can be found on the SQLite website: http://www.sqlite.org.
